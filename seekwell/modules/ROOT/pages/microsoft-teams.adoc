. Set up a schedule to send updates to your teams.

NOTE: If you are part of many teams or channels, it might take a free extra seconds for them to show up in the drop down menu.

IMPORTANT: You can also create SeekWell's xref:stories.adoc[Stories], which let you write narratives about your data using SQL and send directly to MS Teams.
