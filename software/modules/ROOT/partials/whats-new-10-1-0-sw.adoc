In this release, you can try our redesigned and customizable homepage, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more. With the new left-hand navigation, you can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, SpotIQ Analysis, and Monitor Subscriptions.

This new homepage experience is disabled by default. Contact your ThoughtSpot administrator to enable this feature for your cluster. After that, open your user profile, and in the _Experience_ section, set the _Navigation and Homepage_ to *New experience*. Note that this setting also enables persona-based navigation.

In this release, you can try our completely redesigned navigation experience organized by persona. The new app switcher allows business users, analysts, data engineers, administrators, and developers to work in separate contextual sections designed specifically for their needs. In addition, each app has left-hand navigation to create better consistency and ease of use for users switching between the different apps.

=== Null and missing values in charts

// Naomi -- scal-169683. documentation JIRA scal-201035.
// PM: Manan

You can now choose how null and missing values appear in line, column, and bar charts in ThoughtSpot. Null and missing values appear as bars of 1 pixel width on bar and column charts. You can choose whether to display null date values as zero values, line breaks, or an average of proximate values on a line chart. Rather than showing a sharp decline to zero every time there is null or missing data on your line chart, you can see the missing values represented as line breaks or averages of the closest values instead.

=== Semi-additive measures with first and last values
// Naomi – SCAL-207067. docs JIRA SCAL-214756
// PM: Damian

Semi-additive measures with first and last values are now available to all users and on by default. A semi-additive measure, also known as snapshot data, is a measure that is usually aggregated for all attributes except for date and time. For certain measures, like inventory, you want to know what the value was at the beginning or end of a period. In that case, you can use the `last_value` function to find the inventory at the end of a month, rather than aggregating all values over the month. Similarly, you can use the `first_value` function to find out your stock at the beginning of a month.

=== Keywords "of" and "percentage of"

// Naomi -- SCAL-151987, docs JIRA SCAL-201298
// PM: Damian


The "of" and "percentage of" keywords are now on by default and available to all users. You can use the "of" and "percentage of" keywords to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios. These keywords help answer questions such as, "What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?" To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*.

=== Drill down in change analysis

// Naomi – SCAL-180942. doc: SCAL-205576 (approved)
// PM: Vikas

Drill down in change analysis is now on by default and available to all users. You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. For example, if you run an analysis on sales monthly and find out that the 'jacket' item type changed the most, you can easily drill down on jacket sales and identify which region contributed the most to the change in sales.

// Naomi – SCAL-181312. documentation JIRA scal-201645.

Personalized columns are now available to all users and on by default. Users with edit permissions on a Liveboard can set their preferred attribute columns through the change analysis window and select *Apply to all users* to keep those selections for any subsequent change analysis calculations on that Liveboard. Individual users can still override these preferences for their own calculations.
