In this release, you can try our redesigned and customizable homepage, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more. With the new left-hand navigation, you can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, SpotIQ Analysis, and Monitor Subscriptions.

This new homepage experience is disabled by default. Contact your ThoughtSpot administrator to enable this feature for your cluster. After that, open your user profile, and in the _Experience_ section, set the _Navigation and Homepage_ to *New experience*. Note that this setting also enables persona-based navigation.

In this release, you can try our completely redesigned navigation experience organized by persona. The new app switcher allows business users, analysts, data engineers, administrators, and developers to work in separate contextual sections designed specifically for their needs. In addition, each app has left-hand navigation to create better consistency and ease of use for users switching between the different apps.

=== Null and missing values in charts

// Naomi -- scal-169683. documentation JIRA scal-201035.
// PM: Manan

You can now choose how null and missing values appear in line, column, and bar charts in ThoughtSpot. Null and missing values appear as bars of 1 pixel width on bar and column charts. You can choose whether to display null date values as zero values, line breaks, or an average of proximate values on a line chart. Rather than showing a sharp decline to zero every time there is null or missing data on your line chart, you can see the missing values represented as line breaks or averages of the closest values instead.

=== Semi-additive measures with first and last values
// Naomi – SCAL-207067. docs JIRA SCAL-214756
// PM: Damian

Semi-additive measures with first and last values are now available to all users and on by default. A semi-additive measure, also known as snapshot data, is a measure that is usually aggregated for all attributes except for date and time. For certain measures, like inventory, you want to know what the value was at the beginning or end of a period. In that case, you can use the `last_value` function to find the inventory at the end of a month, rather than aggregating all values over the month. Similarly, you can use the `first_value` function to find out your stock at the beginning of a month.

// Naomi -- SCAL-151987, docs JIRA SCAL-201298
// PM: Damian


The "of" and "percentage of" keywords are now on by default and available to all users. You can use the "of" and "percentage of" keywords to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios. These keywords help answer questions such as, "What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?" To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*.

=== Drill down in change analysis

// Naomi – SCAL-180942. doc: SCAL-205576 (approved)
// PM: Vikas

Drill down in change analysis is now on by default and available to all users. You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. For example, if you run an analysis on sales monthly and find out that the 'jacket' item type changed the most, you can easily drill down on jacket sales and identify which region contributed the most to the change in sales.

// Mary – SCAL-140254. doc: SCAL-201825
// PM: Arpit

ThoughtSpot introduces support for scheduling Liveboards with Excel (XLSX) attachments, in addition to the existing PDF and CSV options. This allows users to explore tabular data from these reports by using the XLSX data files. For more information, see xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc[Schedule a Liveboard job].

[#10-1-0-sw-liveboard-filters]
=== Filters available for Liveboards with hidden columns included in a visualization
//Mary. epic: SCAL-157372. doc: SCAL-201823
You can now change the filter values on Liveboards that have visualizations that include hidden columns, or a formula created from a hidden column.
Liveboard filters are now accessible to all users who have view or edit permissions to the underlying data source.

NOTE: Previously, users who did not have edit access to the underlying worksheet of a Liveboard with filters, could not update the Liveboard filters if the Liveboard used a hidden column. This was the case even if the user had view access to the underlying worksheets. While you can now change filter values on the visualizations, you cannot change filters created directly on the hidden column. To get hidden column filter access, you must have edit access to the data source and the Can manage data privilege.

Personalized columns are now available to all users and on by default. Users with edit permissions on a Liveboard can set their preferred attribute columns through the change analysis window and select *Apply to all users* to keep those selections for any subsequent change analysis calculations on that Liveboard. Individual users can still override these preferences for their own calculations.

You can create sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. Sets can be query sets or column sets. A query set is a custom group of values from a collection of objects in your database. A column set is a custom group of values from a single column. Sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be used by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet. To enable this feature, contact ThoughtSpot Support. For more information, see xref:custom-groups.adoc[Query sets] and xref:custom-sets.adoc[Column sets].

=== Snowflake secondary role configuration for External OAuth
// Naomi – SCAL-191462, documentation jira scal-196178 (approved)

ThoughtSpot now supports secondary role configuration when you create a Snowflake connection using External OAuth. When you set secondary roles to `ALL`, you can access all tables that any single role has access to and combine them in a single SQL query without having to switch roles.

For more information on primary and secondary roles, see

// Naomi – SCAL-148626. documentation jira SCAL-202207 (approved). SCAL-132544. documentation jira SCAL-202209 (approved) waiting on info
// PM: Samridh

You can now use the table TML file to make changes to connection details like remapping columns and changing data type, rather than using the connection.yaml file. This allows you to make small changes to a Connection without the need to resolve all possible errors first. You can also edit or export the Connection TML file from the Data workspace. For more information, see

ThoughtSpot introduces a consistent sort order when exporting the TML of an object (table, SQL view, Liveboard, etc.). This ensures that unnecessary differences don’t show up between TML files when the objects haven’t really changed, and makes it easier to compare TML files.

When creating a Worksheet from a dbt connection, ThoughtSpot joins the tables based on the relationships defined in the underlying .yml schema file. Now, joins between the tables will be created local to the Worksheet instead of creating a global join between the tables.
