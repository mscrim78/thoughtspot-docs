:jira: SCAL-228671


Admin users can now navigate to the ThoughtSpot Status page to monitor the health of services on their cluster. The Status page displays the status of different ThoughtSpot services, like Authentication, Data Connections, Infrastructure Services, KPI Monitor, Search Data, Search Service, SpotIQ, Sync, and Spotter. The page also shares scheduled maintenance timelines, outage notifications, and incident reporting and updates.


NOTE: The ThoughtSpot Status page is in beta and off by default. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.
