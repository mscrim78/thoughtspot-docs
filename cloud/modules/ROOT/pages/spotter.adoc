Introducing Spotter, our new AI-powered, unified conversational search experience. This feature replaces the previous Sage search experience. When enabled, you can enter the Spotter interface from the Spotter module on the Home page, or by clicking *Spotter* on any visualization pinned to a Liveboard.

You can ask successive questions to hone in on business insights, open a preview of the underlying data, drill down, edit or undo changes to the resulting AI-generated Answers, see what terms Spotter changed from answer to answer, and submit feedback on the answers received. Analysts can also coach Spotter to guide Spotter's interpretations from the Data Workspace.


Access Spotter from the Home page *Ask a business question in natural language* module, or by hovering over a visualization in a Liveboard and clicking *Spotter*.


NOTE: Spotter for Liveboards will not be enabled on the following:
Visualizations created using data sources or or Worksheets which are not AI-enabled.
Visualizations using multiple data sources.
Visualizations of the note tile or headline chart type.




== Understanding Spotter


To make it easier to understand how Spotter answers your questions, we surface the search query information in the form of the Answer title and search tokens used to construct the answer. When you ask a follow-up question, Spotter highlights the changes it made in search tokens to answer your question. You can also hover over formulas to see how theyâ€™re calculated, and edit them within Spotter.

To edit an AI-generated Answer in Spotter, click *Edit* next to the search tokens. The *Edit Answer* modal opens. When finished editing, click *Done editing* or *Discard changes*.

You can click a point on the Answer to drill down by different attributes directly from an answer in a conversation or while in edit mode




You can see sample rows of the underlying Worksheet to get a sense of what columns are in the dataset and how the sample rows look by clicking *Preview data*. Note that Preview data is not available for Worksheets with chasm or fan traps.

Spotter treats successive questions in a conversation as a follow-up. If you want to ask a question to start a new analysis, click the *Reset* button. On the Home page, reset lets you start from a fresh question on the selected data source. On a Liveboard, reset takes you back to the original visualization.




== Coach Spotter


You can coach Spotter from the Data Workspace by addressing feedback given on AI-generated Answers, both by specific business terms and by complete reference questions. This capability, previously called xref:sage-coach.adoc[Sage Coach], allows you to refine the way Spotter responds to questions. When users with Worksheet edit privileges provide feedback, the feedback level is global by default.


== Choose LLM for Spotter


Admin users can decide which LLM to use to enable all ThoughtSpot AI features. By default, ThoughtSpot uses Azure OpenAI. For 10.4.0.cl, we are offering support for Google Gemini. To manage your choice of LLM, navigate to *Admin > ThoughtSpot AI* and edit the *Choice of LLM* option.
