[#10-5-0-cl-anomaly]
[discrete]
=== Anomaly-based alerts
Anomaly-based alerts are now on by default and available to all users. You can receive alerts when data of KPIs you are subscribed to fall outside the predicted value range.
//To create an anomaly alert, navigate to your KPI, select the more options icon image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu] on the KPI, click *Manage alerts*, and select *Anomaly*.
When creating an alert, you can specify the time and frequency at which ThoughtSpot checks the KPI’s data against the values predicted by ML models trained on the data. For example, you can create an alert for a `sales weekly` KPI, and specify that ThoughtSpot compare the values every Monday at 5 PM. You may also add individual subscribers to the alert. If the KPI's data falls outside the predicted range, ThoughtSpot sends an alert to your email and, if applicable, your subscribers' emails.

You can click *View details* to see the changes by attribute, or select *Customize* to change which measures or attributes to analyze. Note that when you run change analysis on a chart created with ratio keywords like `average`, you see the previous change analysis interface, one attribute at a time.

Previously, time-series KPI charts had limited options when comparing to past periods. A weekly KPI could be compared against the previous week, the previous month's same week, the previous quarter's same week, or the previous year's same week. Now, you can set a custom point in data against which ThoughtSpot compares the most recent data point, any number of weeks ago. Your chosen comparison point persists for all viewers of the Liveboard. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

Admin users now have more control on how users sign in to Connections authenticated using OAuth when the connection authentication has expired. Previously, the *Sign in with OAuth* button appeared only on Liveboards built on the Connection. Now, users can access the sign-in flow from Search Data and Answers as well.

////
* Using the Automatic OAuth Sign-in Trigger option in the Early Access panel, admin users can set the *Sign in with OAuth* button to be automatically triggered in a Liveboard, Answer, or Search Data page when the authentication of the underlying Connections expires.
* Using the OAuth Redirection Behavior option in the Early Access panel, admin users can ensure that the connection authentication flow opens in the current page, rather than a new tab.
