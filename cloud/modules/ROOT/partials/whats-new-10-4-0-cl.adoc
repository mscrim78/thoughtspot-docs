Introducing Spotter, our new AI-powered, unified conversational search experience. This feature replaces the previous Sage search experience. When enabled, you can enter the Spotter interface from the search bar on the Home page, or by clicking *Spotter* on any visualization pinned to a Liveboard.

You can ask successive questions to hone in on business insights, open a preview of the underlying data, drill down, edit or undo changes to the resulting AI-generated Answers, see what terms Spotter changed from question to question, and submit feedback to train Spotter's interpretations. Analysts can also coach Spotter on how to interpret certain terms from the Admin page. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

We made the following changes to visualizations on Liveboards:

* You can now hover over items in a visualization's legend to highlight the data that corresponds to that column.
* You can hover over a truncated legend to see the corresponding column name in a tooltip.
* We improved the readability for the smallest size of Liveboard visualizations. Now, minimum-sized visualizations display only the chart, omitting the x- and y-axes and labels. You can hover over select data points to see the values.

Models are now available to all customers and enabled by default. Worksheets are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Existing Worksheets continue to be available and editable, but Worksheet creation is disabled by default. To enable Worksheet creation, you must contact your ThoughSpot administrator. You can migrate an individual Worksheet to a Model. Bulk migration of Worksheets to Models will be available in the 10.5.0.cl release.

We made the following changes to permissions regarding version control:

* Admin users can now assign the *Can set up version control* privilege to allow non-admin users to access the version control settings under *Admin > Application settings*, and to use Version Control REST v2 APIs.

* We renamed the previous *Can manage version control* permission to *Can toggle version control for objects*. Users with this permission and edit access to a ThoughtSpot object can enable or disable version history for that object.
