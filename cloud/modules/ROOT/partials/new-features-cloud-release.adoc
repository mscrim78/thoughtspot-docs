Custom comparison point for KPI charts [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::
Previously, time-series KPI charts had limited options when comparing to past periods. A weekly KPI could be compared against the previous week, the previous month's same week, the previous quarter's same week, or the previous year's same week. Now, you can set a custom point in data against which ThoughtSpot compares the most recent data point, any number of weeks ago. Your chosen comparison point persists for all viewers of the Liveboard. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

OAuth Connections sign-in for Search Data and Answer view:: Admin users now have more control on how users sign in to Connections authenticated using OAuth when the connection authentication has expired. Previously, the *Sign in with OAuth* button appeared only on Liveboards built on the Connection. Now, users can access the sign-in flow from Search Data and Answers as well.
